the way we're writing to output files,
we can't stream it, because it writes each line
of output from the command as it happens,
but it writes it to an open stream, 
which it does not close until the command
is finished.

what if you just want everything to frikin
work like a unix command line utility?
the logging, the flags, the robustness,
the simplicity, the lightweight footprint
