There are also various subdomains set up (www, git, files), all pointing to the same location. nginx domain handling \u00b6 Nginx handles all of the domains by specifying a different domain_name in each server{} block of the nginx config files. For example: server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name charlesreid1.com; ... } server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name charlesreid1.blue; ... } server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name charlesreid1.red; ... } See the conf.d dir of d-nginx-charlesreid1 . We will cover this in the nginx ports section, but all http urls are redirected to https urls. Ports \u00b6 overview \u00b6 The apache-mediawiki combination is running an apache service listening on port 8989. This can be adjusted, but should be adjusted in the Dockerfile, ports.conf , and wiki.conf . The apache service listens on all interfaces (hence *:8989 in the apache conf file), but there is no port mapping specified in docker-compose.yml so it does not listen on any public interfaces. Thus, the wiki is not publicly accessible via port 8989, but the wiki is available via port 8989 to any container linked to, or connected to the same network as, the mediawiki apache container. Meanwhile, the nginx container has a public interface listening on port 80 and another listening on port 443. nginx listens for requests going to the wiki, detected via the url resource prefix being /w/ or /wiki/ , and acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding the requests to Apache. The user transparently sees everything happening via port 80 or (preferrably) 443, but on the backend nginx is passing along the URL request and returning the result. Subdomains are served via reverse proxy on port 7777+. The webhook server is a flask server listening on port 50000. nginx ports \u00b6 Also see nginx service . Nginx has two main public-facing ports: port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS). All requests to http:// urls go to port 80, and all requests to https:// urls go to port 443. The server will automatically redirect all requests to port 80 to port 443, turning all http requests into https requests. Nginx also exposes port 3000 and forwards it along to git.charlesreid1.com . This is for legacy reasons. To work with MediaWiki, nginx must implement rewrite rules: nginx listens for requests going to wiki URLs (prefixed with /w/ or /wiki ) and proxies those to the correct container. mediawiki/apache ports \u00b6 Also see mediawiki service and apache/php service . The MediaWiki server runs on a PHP and Apache stack. Inside the MediaWiki container, Apache listens on port 8989. This port only connects to the nginx container, so nginx is the only service that can connect to MediaWiki, and only over port 8989. This nginx-apache connection is not encrypted because it happens on the same machine. When the user connects to the wiki, for example at the url https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Nmap the user's connection is with the nginx server. The session is an https session happening over port 443 and signed by nginx's certificates. If the user goes to http://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Nmap on port 80, this is rewritten to https://charlesreid1.com/wiki/Nmap on port 443. In nginx, this is done with a 301: server { listen 80; listen [::]:80; server_name charlesreid1.com; location / { return 301 https://charlesreid1.com$request_uri; } } Note that nginx plays the role of a central dispatcher in the charlesreid1 pod - all containers connect to nginx and only nginx, while nginx exposes each container to the outside world via requests for various subdomains being redirected to different ports. phpmyadmin ports \u00b6 Also see phpmyadmin service . phpMyAdmin provides a web interface for MySQL databases. This follows a similar pattern to the MediaWiki Apache container: The phpMyAdmin container is connected to the MySQL container via the docker network created by the docker-compose command (no container links needed) The phpMyAdmin container runs an HTTP web interface available inside the container on port 80. This service is exposed on port 80 on the internal docker network only. Since phpMyAdmin only listens on the Docker pod network for incoming requests, all requests to phpMyAdmin must come through nginx via reverse proxy. These are forwarded to port 80 of the phpMyAdmin container on the back end. We keep phpMyAdmin disabled on a regular basis, as it is not heavily used and provides access to sensitive data and operations. To control access to phpMyAdmin, configure the nginx service to whitelist certain IPs to access phpMyAdmin (or shut off all access). mysql ports \u00b6 Also see mysql service . The MySQL container listens on port 3306 by default. The container is only bound to the MediaWiki container, so MediaWiki is the only service that can access MySQL. gitea ports \u00b6 Also see gitea service . Requests for the subdomain git.charlesreid1.com are redirected to port 3000 on the docker internal container network, where gitea is listening. Like the MediaWiki and phpMyAdmin containers, this follows the same reverse proxy pattern: The nginx service handles front-end requests and reverse proxies those rquests to gitea over the internal docker container network. Gitea listens to port 3000 and is bound to the local docker network only. Gitea does not implement HTTP on the back end; nginx handles HTTPS with client on the front end. python file server ports \u00b6 Also see python files service . We have a simple, lightweight Python HTTP server on port 8081 on the Docker network. This container runs the following Python command to start the server: python -m http.server -b <bind-address> 8081 This works because Python provides a built-in HTTP server that, if no index.html file is present, will provide a directory listing. This is as simple as it gets, as far as file servers go. This follows the same reverse proxy pattern: Python HTTP server listens for incoming requests on port 8081 on the Docker network only. Client requests are reverse proxied by d-nginx-charlesreid1 on the front end. The server does not handle HTTPS, this is also handled by the nginx container on the frontend. The bind address and port of the Python HTTP server are set in the command line. The <bind-address> should be set to the name of the docker container image ( stormy_files ). The command python -m http.server -b stormy_files 8081 listens on port 8081 inside the python file server container stormy_files (the container itself). The nginx server reverse-proxies requests for https://files.charlesreid1.com and forwards them to the container. Note: this container can be expanded to a container that serves multiple directories on multiple ports by using twisted. See the d-python-helium repository for an example.","title":"Domains and Ports"},{"location":"Ports/#domains-and-ports","text":"","title":"Domains and Ports"},{"location":"Ports/#domains","text":"There are three domains pointing to this server: charlesreid1.com charlesreid1.red charlesreid1.blue These are pointing to the server's IP address using an A NAME DNS record.

Use docker-compose to run the pod. The Docker Compose File \u00b6 The docker-compose.yml file contains all the directives needed to run a docker pod of containers that make Charlesreid1.com work. Why use docker-compose instead of docker? docker-compose is the preferred way to run multiple containers. Huh? Where's docker-compose.yml?? Instead of a docker-compose.yml file, you'll see a docker-compose.fixme.yml file. You need to fix this YML file by hard-coding your MYSQL password in the file. See the steps below. Running Charlesreid1 Docker Pod from Command Line \u00b6 We start by covering how to run the docker pod from the command line. First, set the MySQL password using a sed one-liner: $ sed \"s/REPLACEME/YoFooThisIsYourNewPassword/\" docker-compose.fixme.yml > docker-compose.yml Now you can run the container pod with docker-compose up # interactive docker-compose up -d # detached or, if you want to rebuild all the containers before running up, docker-compose up --build If you just want to rebuild the containers, docker-compose build and this will rebuild the containers from scratch: docker-compose build --no-cache WARNING: for large, complicated container images, this command can take a very long time. Use with care.) You can restart all containers in a pod using the restart command: docker-compose restart WARNING: this will NOT pick up changes to Dockerfiles or to files that are mounted into the container. This simply restarts the container using the same image (in memory) that was previously running, without getting an up-to-date container image. Running Charlesreid1 Docker Pod as Startup Service \u00b6 If you want to run the pod as a startup service, see the dotfiles/debian repository, in the services/ subdirectory. You will find a systemd service that will start/stop the docker pod. dockerpod-charlesereid1.service: [Unit] Description=charlesreid1 docker pod Requires=docker.service After=docker.service [Service] Restart=always ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/charles/codes/docker/pod-charlesreid1/docker-compose.yml up ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f /home/charles/codes/docker/pod-charlesreid1/docker-compose.yml stop [Install] WantedBy=default.target Now install the service to /etc/systemd/system/dockerpod-charlesreid1.servce , and activate it: sudo systemctl enable dockerpod-charlesreid1.service Now you can start/stop the service with: sudo systemctl (start|stop) dockerpod-charlesreid1.service NOTE: if you need to debug the containers, or update any config files copied into the container, be sure and stop the service before doing a docker-compose stop or a docker-compose up --build , otherwise the pod will continually respawn. Workflow for Charlesreid1 Docker Pod Updates \u00b6 This section covers a workflow if you're updating the docker pod. As noted abobve, a simple docker-compose restart won't pick up changes in Dockerfiles or files mounted into the image, so you often need to stop the containers and restart them after rebuilding the container images. However, if you update your files (particularly if you add a lot of new apt packages), it can take a long time to build the containers. This can result in a lot of downtime if you take the containers down before rebuilding them. To minimize downtime, use the following workflow: Run docker-compose build to rebuild the images, leaving the pod running (they are not affected) Run docker-compose down to bring the pod down Run docker-compose up to bring the pod up It may take a few seconds to bring the pod down, and that will be your total amount of downtime. If you make a thousand dollars a second and can't afford your site to be down for even a few seconds of downtime, hire me and I'll tell you how to do it with ZERO downtime. Restoring Docker Pod from Backups \u00b6 Now that the pod is running, you probably need to seed it with data. You will need two mediawiki restore files and two gitea restore files, everything else comes from git.charlesreid1.com or github.com (this will create a bootstrapping problem if you have no git.charlesreid1.com): MediaWiki database backup MediaWiki files (images) backup Gitea dump zip file Gitea avatars zip file Now you can restore the database as follows: MySQL database restore scripts for MediaWiki are in utils-mysql/ dir MediaWiki image directory restore scripts are in utils-mw/ dir Gitea database and avatars come from backups using scripts in utils-gitea/ dir mysql restore \u00b6 To restore a database from a dump: cd utils-mysql/ ./restore_database.sh /path/to/dump/wikidb.sql The MySQL container must be running for this to work. (You may need to adjust the MySQL container name in the script.) mediawiki restore \u00b6 To restore the MediaWiki images directory: cd utils-mw/ ./restore_wikifiles.sh /path/to/wikifiles.tar.gz gitea restore \u00b6 The gitea container can be restored from a backup as follows: cd utils-gitea/ ./restore_gitea.sh /path/to/gitea-dump.zip /path/to/gitea-avatars.zip","title":"Running the Pod"},{"location":"Running/#running-the-charlesreid1-docker-pod","text":"The charlesreid1.com site runs in a Docker pod.

The Apache server is reverse-proxied by nginx in the final pod configuration. Configuration Files and Folders \u00b6 To set up the MediaWiki container, we have to copy in the following files: One configuration file LocalSettings.php Two directories: extensions/ skins/ Both LocalSettings.php and skins/ are under version control. The extensions/ directory is assembled from git repositories directly, and so is not under version control. Where Does Stuff Live? \u00b6 The LocalSettings.php file and skins/ folder live in the d-mediawiki submodule (see docker/d-mediawiki on git.charlesreid1.com), in the charlesreid1-config sub-submodule (see wiki/charlesreid1-config on git.charlesreid1.com), in the mediawiki/ directory. That's also where the extensions/ directory goes. There is also a script in the wiki/charlesreid1-config repo called build_extensions_dir.sh that clone copies of each MediaWiki extension. Inside the MediaWiki container, the live HTML directory is at /var/www/html/ . That is where LocalSettings.php , skins/ , and extensions/ live in the container. The /var/www/html/ directory is marked as a VOLUME in the Dockerfile and is the mount point for a docker data volume, stormy_mediawiki_data . See wiki/charlesreid1-config on git.charlesreid1.com. Getting Stuff Into The Container \u00b6 The configuration files mentioned above (LocalSettings, skins, and extensions) must be copied into the container at build time. This is done in the MediaWiki Dockerfile - see d-mediawiki . Why don't we bind-mount them into the container? We will have problems mounting files to a directory that is itself a mount point. Since /var/www/html/ is a mount point for the MediaWiki container's data volume, to keep the wiki's files persistent, we can't also bind-mount files at /var/www/html/. Additionally, we have to change the permissions of LocalSettings.pp to 600 and change the ownership of all files in /var/www/html/ to www-data:www-data , the Apache web server user, so that it can serve up the wiki. LocalSettings.php is copied into the container at /var/www/html/LocalSettings.php . skins/ is copied into the container at /var/www/html/skins/ (we use our own customized theme, in the Bootstrap2 directory). extensions/ is copied into the container at /var/www/html/extensions/ (make sure you run build_extensions_dir.sh first!). build_extensions_dir.sh Enabling MediaWiki Math \u00b6 Note that we have one last task to complete, and that is enabling the math extensions so that we can add formulas to our wiki. To do this, we have to add the following aptitude packages to an apt-get install command in the Dockerfile: RUN apt-get update && \\ apt-get install -y build-essential \\ dvipng \\ ocaml \\ ghostscript \\ imagemagick \\ texlive-latex-base \\ texlive-latex-extra \\ texlive-fonts-recommended \\ texlive-lang-greek \\ texlive-latex-recommended (Note: ocaml is a language required to make texvc , covered below.) Next, we need to shim a make command into the container's entrypoint command, before we run the Apache web server. To enable equations and math, we need to make a utility called texvc by running make in the Math extension directory. We modify the CMD directive in the Dockerfile, which normally runs apache2-foreground in the stock MediaWiki container. Change the original CMD from this: CMD apache2-foreground to this: CMD cd /var/www/html/extensions/Math/math && make && apache2-foreground Updating Skin or LocalSettings.php \u00b6 Note that if you update the MediaWiki skin or the LocalSettings.php file, you will need to rebuild the container and restart it. (It's a pain in the ass, but hard to avoid.) Alternatively, you can use docker cp to copy a new LocalSettings.php or skins directory into the running MediaWiki container. These changes will be reflected immediately in the wiki interface. (Be careful with this method!!!) Best of all possible worlds: your LocalSettings.php and skins/ directory is under version control, as in wiki/charlesreid1-config on git.charlesreid1.com, and can be updated with a git push or git pull. (This is not currently how it is structured, as the skin and LocalSettings.php files are not under version control in the container. This would be difficult for the same reason that it is difficult to bind-mount a file directly into /var/www/html - because it is also difficult to have a particular file under version control when there are a large number of other files in that directory.) A Way Out? A Path Forward? A Glimmer of Hope? \u00b6 How might we fix this nested, nightarish mess? A couple of things have to happen: Docker needs to provide better control over user ownership and file permissions for bind-mounted directories.

This allows bind-mounting a configuration directory to /etc/nginx/ without complication. Unfortunately, MediaWiki mixes site-specific user files with generic, common-across-all-MediaWikis php files, making it difficult to version-control site-specific user files.

Configuration Files \u00b6 The nginx container is critical to routing operations on charlesreid1.com, so we cover how the configuration files are split up and organized on this page, and include a summary of each file below. Where are the nginx config files? \u00b6 Nginx configuration files are located in the d-nginx-charlesreid1 submodule of this repository, which points to the docker/d-nginx-charlesreid1 repository. Within that repository is the conf.d/ folder, which contains several .conf files. What Files Are There? \u00b6 We have three sets of files present: HTTP config files that redirect HTTP traffic on port 80 to be HTTPS traffic on port 443, one for each top-level domain (charlesreid1.com, charlesreid1.blue, and charlesreid1.red): http.com.charlesreid1.conf http.red.charlesreid1.conf http.blue.charlesreid1.conf HTTPS rules for charlesreid1.com endpoints (the wiki, phpMyAdmin, and ignoring .git directories): https.com.charlesreid1.conf https.red.charlesreid1.conf https.blue.charlesreid1.conf HTTPS rules for subdomains (pages.charlesreid1.com, hooks.charlesreid1.com, bots.charlesreid1.com): https.com.charlesreid1.subdomains.conf https.red.charlesreid1.subdomains.conf https.blue.charlesreid1.subdomains.conf HTTP Config Files \u00b6 The HTTP config files are listed below: http.com.charlesreid1.conf http.red.charlesreid1.conf http.blue.charlesreid1.conf The HTTP config files do the following: Requests for port 80 (for a domain or subdomain) are always redirected to port 443 for the same domain/subdomain HTTPS Config Files \u00b6 The HTTPS config files are listed below: https.com.charlesreid1.conf https.red.charlesreid1.conf https.blue.charlesreid1.conf The HTTPS config files (without \"subdomain\" in their name) do the following: Requests for / are redirected to the htdocs folders mentioned above Requests for /w/ or /wiki/ are reverse-proxied to the local Apache+PHP container on port 8989 (Optional) requests for /phpMyAdmin/ are reverse-proxied to the local phpMyAdmin container on port 80 Requests for git.charlesreid1.com are reverse-proxied to the local Gitea container on port 3000 Requests for files.charlesreid1.com are reverse-proxied to the local Python files on port 8081 HTTPS Subdomain Config Files \u00b6 The HTTPS subdomain config files are listed below: https.com.charlesreid1.subdomains.conf https.red.charlesreid1.subdomains.conf https.blue.charlesreid1.subdomains.conf The subdomains config files redirect requests for a set of subdomains on charlesreid1.com, namely: pages.charlesreid1.com hooks.charlesreid1.com bots.charlesreid1.com This charlesreid1.com docker pod will redirect requests for these subdomains to another server running another docker pod, called the webhook docker pod, available at docker/pod-webhooks ). The webhook docker pod runs an nginx server, both to serve up static sites that live under the https://pages.charlesreid1.com domain, and to handle webhook traffic - the container also runs a Python webhook server that receives webhooks from git.charlesreid1.com, which enables push-to-deploy functionality similar to Github Pages. Also see https://pages.charlesreid1.com/pod-webhooks/ . Why All The Config Files? \u00b6 If everything is stuffed into a smaller number of nginx config files, they become long and unwieldy, and more prone to mistakes. HTTP config files only contain redirects HTTPS (no subdomain) config files handle Getting Configuration Files Into Container \u00b6 The configuration files are mounted into the container by bind-mounting the conf.d folder of the d-nginx-charlesreid1 submodule at /et/nginx/conf.d in the container. This is done in the charlesreid1 pod docker-compose file . Static Content \u00b6 The nginx container hosts static content, in addition to serving as a reverse-proxy for several other services. This section covers how static content is treated by the charlesreid1.com nginx container Outside the Container: /www/ \u00b6 Static content hosted by the container is stored on the host machine in /www/ . Each site (e.g., charlesreid1.com) has its own folder, containing the source for the static site and an htdocs folder containing the static content actually being hosted. Additionally, because the static content for the site is actually contained on the gh-pages branch of charlesreid1/charlesreid1.com , the htodcs folder is actually a git repository. When it is cloned, it is cloned such that the git repo's contents go into /www/charlesreid1.com/htdocs/ and the contents of the .git folder go into /www/charlesreid1.com/git . This allows the site static content to be updated to reflect the contents of the gh-pages branch by pulling the latest upstream changes into htdocs. The directory structure used is as follows: /www /charlesreid1.com /charlesreid1-src ...source for pelican site... /htdocs ...static content... /git ...dot git folder... /charlesreid1.blue /charlesreid1-blue-src ...source for pelican site... /htodcs ...static content... /git ...dot git folder... /charlesreid1.red /charlesreid1-red-src ...source for pelican site... /htodcs ...static content... /git ...dot git folder... This directory structure can be achieved using the following bash command: REPOURL=\"https://git.charlesreid1.com/charlesreid1/charlesreid1.com.git\" git -C /www/example.com \\ clone \\ --separate-git-dir=git \\ -b gh-pages \\ $REPOURL htdocs The dotfiles/debian repository contains scripts for krash, which runs the charlesreid1.com pod, to set up the directory structure as above, as well as scripts to pull the latest changes from upstream for each of the live web directories above. Inside the Container: /usr/share/nginx/html \u00b6 Once the contents of the /www/ directory have been set up, the content can be made avialable inside the container by bind-mounting the htdocs directories into the /www/ directory inside the container. This is done with the following volume directives in the docker-compose.yml file : volumes: - \"/www/charlesreid1.blue/htdocs:/www/charlesreid1.blue/htdocs:ro\" - \"/www/charlesreid1.red/htdocs:/www/charlesreid1.red/htdocs:ro\" - \"/www/charlesreid1.com/htdocs:/www/charlesreid1.com/htdocs:ro\" ... Utility Scripts: Updating Site Contents \u00b6 In the krash_scripts/ folder of the debian/dotfiles](https://git.charlesreid1.com/dotfiles/debian) repository, there are several utility scripts to help with setting up and updating this directory structure. To set up the directory structure, use the git_clone_www.sh script . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #!/bin/bash REPOURL = \"https://git.charlesreid1.com/charlesreid1/charlesreid1.com.git\" git -C /www/example.com \\ clone \\ --separate-git-dir = git \\ -b gh-pages \\ $REPOURL htdocs To update the contents of the htdocs/ folder using the latest changes on the gh-pages branch, use the git_pull_www.sh script . 1 2 3 4 5 #!/bin/bash git -C /www/example.com \\ --git-dir = git --work-tree = htdocs \\ pull origin gh-pages SSL Certificates \u00b6 We utilize Let's Encrypt to issue SSL certificates for our domain. This is a pain because of the need to automatically renew certificates every 90 days, and because of missing information in their documentation. Where To Put Certificates \u00b6 We leave the certificates where Let's Encrypt puts them, namely, in /etc/letsencrypt/live . The certificates are bind-mounted into the container at the same location, /etc/letsencrypt/live . The docker-compose.yml file then contains the following: volumes: - \"/etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt\" ... Which Server Needs Certificates \u00b6 Because the d-nginx-charlesreid1 docker container is serving as the front-end nginx server handling all incoming charlesreid1.com web requests, it is also the one negotiating HTTPS sessions with clients, so it is the container that needs the Let's Encrypt certificates. This means that, for example, the SSL certificate for pages.charlesreid1.com is on krash, even though the content served up by the site is on blackbeard. Getting and Renewing Certificates \u00b6 Once you have worked everything out and gotten auto-renew cron scripts running smoothly, everything is unicorns and rainbows. But when you hit the Let's Encrypt rate limit because they did not explain it properly in the documentation, you may want everyone to die. Let's Encrypt provides a command line utility called certbot that can be used to automate the process of creating and renewing certificates. See the charlesreid1/certbot repository for scripts. The basic setup is as follows: Use the krash_make_cert.sh script (which wraps the make_cert.sh script) to create SSL certificates for each domain and subdomain Use the krash_renew.sh script (which wraps the renew_cert.sh script) to renew SSL certificates for each domain and subdomain Certificates must be renewed every 90 days. I run the certificate renewal script in the root acount's crontab every 15 days so the certs never expire.
