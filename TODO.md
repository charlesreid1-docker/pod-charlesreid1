# TODO

- rebuild and restart for slimmer python files container
- logging? messages? status? plugging docker-compose into netdata?
    - want to avoid a few things:
    - giant pileup of gigabytes of logs, getting bit in the ass
    - giant pileup of container stuff, completely running out of space
    - second almost happened, at 97% or so
